# Task Plan

_Active tasks go here. Checked off as completed. New plan replaces old when task is done._
_Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — [task name]`_

## How to use this file

- I write the plan here before touching anything on multi-step tasks
- Each item is a checkable step
- When done: add a `## Review` section with outcome + any surprises
- Completed tasks get archived in a `## Archive` section at the bottom

## Archive

_Completed tasks will be logged here with dates._
