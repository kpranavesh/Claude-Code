## Existing Ideas (Logged, Not Yet Executed)

| Idea | Category | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **WARNAlert** | **B2B SaaS + marketplace** | **Business plan written — pre-validation** | **Score: 8.5/10. WARN Act filing monitor → recruiter alerts (paid $125/mo) + employee alerts (free). Two-sided flywheel. Closest competitor WARNwise lacks employee layer. Data: WARN Firehose API. Next: 20 recruiter cold messages before building.** |
| Baby food tracking app | Consumer app | Inspiration only | Observed gap — not built by Krishna |
| Subtitle/NLP API | B2B SaaS | Concept | Cross-lingual search + audio subtitle parsing |
| Quant finance content | Content/media | Concept | Articles, TikTok, Instagram on stocks & investing |
| TikTok: AI agents & automation | Content | Concept | How to build agents, automation for regular people |
| Zach Wilson-style data eng content | Content/edu | Concept | Data engineering tutorials and frameworks |
| Mindtrip travel content | Content | Concept | AI + travel discovery |
| Flowise AI flows | Tool/SaaS | Concept | Custom LLM flow builder, no-code |

## Income Potential Scoring Preferences

When scoring business ideas, weight these factors:

| Dimension | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Remote-friendly | 30% | Hard requirement |
| Realistic MRR potential ($1K–$10K+) | 25% | Needs to be real income |
| Buildable solo with AI tools | 20% | No hiring required to start |
| Aligns with existing skills | 15% | Python, LLM, finance, data |
| Low time-per-dollar ratio | 10% | Async / scalable preferred |

---

## Score Thresholds

- **8–10:** Strong match — should seriously explore
- **6–7:** Good fit — worth a weekend prototype
- **4–5:** Partial fit — would require skill gap or major time investment
- **< 4:** Poor fit — deprioritize

---

## What Makes an Idea Resonate

An idea passes the bar only when all three are present:

1. **Named, countable vertical** — not "SMBs" or "knowledge workers." A vertical you can enumerate: 370K HOAs, 50K indie game studios, 200K HOA board presidents. If you can't name the first 10 customers by job title before building, the niche is too vague.
2. **Non-technical buyer with budget** — someone who pays on outcome (time saved, risk reduced, revenue gained), not on spec. No procurement cycle, no IT approval required. Ideal buyer: a frustrated professional who can expense $75–150/mo without asking their boss.
3. **Price gap** — free/DIY on one end, expensive enterprise ($300+/mo) on the other, with nothing credible in between. The price point should feel like an obvious choice, not a negotiation.

Missing any one of these is a disqualifier — not a weakness to work around.

---

## Idea Pitch Standard (Minimum Required to Take It Seriously)

A pitch missing any of these gets rejected outright:

- **The specific pain** — one sentence naming the exact friction, with real evidence (Reddit thread, competitor review, forum complaint, pricing page). "PMs at Series B startups don't know what competitors are patenting" beats "companies lack competitive intelligence."
- **The specific user archetype** — name the buyer, their job title, their current workaround, and what they're doing today instead of using your product.
- **Competitor landscape + pricing gap** — at least 2 named competitors with prices, and the exact gap this product fills. "There's no good solution" is never true and always lazy.
- **Non-obviousness test** — if the idea appears on any "top 10 AI business ideas 2026" listicle, it's disqualified. What insight makes this invisible to the average person scanning the space?
- **90-day rollout with a validation gate** — the first milestone must be validation (customer conversations, waitlist signups, Substack post response), not a shipped product. Build nothing until the signal is there.
- **Path to $5K MRR** — specific price × specific customer count × specific acquisition channel. No hand-waving about "scale."
